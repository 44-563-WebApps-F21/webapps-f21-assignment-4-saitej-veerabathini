    <h2>An Ideal Husband.</h2>
    <h4>ACT III. The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street.</h4>
    <p>LORD GORING. Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>


    <p>PHIPPS. Yes, my lord.</p>

    <p>LORD GORING. [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.] And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.</p>

    <p>PHIPPS. Yes, my lord.</p>

    <p>LORD GORING. Other people are quite dreadful. The only possible society
        is oneself.</p>

    <p>PHIPPS. Yes, my lord.</p>

    <p>LORD GORING. To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
        Phipps.</p>

    <p>PHIPPS. Yes, my lord.</p>

    <p>LORD GORING. [_Looking at himself in the glass_.] Don’t think I quite
        like this buttonhole, Phipps. Makes me look a little too old. Makes me
        almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?</p>

    <p>PHIPPS. I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.</p>
