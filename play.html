    <h2>An Ideal Husband.</h2>

    <h4>ACT III. The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street.</h4>

    <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p>Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>


    <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

    <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p>[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]</p> <p>And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.</p>

    <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

    <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p>Other people are quite dreadful. The only possible society
        is oneself.</p>

    <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

    <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p>To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
        Phipps.</p>

    <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

    <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p>[_Looking at himself in the glass_.]</p> <p>Don’t think I quite
        like this buttonhole, Phipps. Makes me look a little too old. Makes me
        almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?</p>

    <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> <p>I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.</p>
